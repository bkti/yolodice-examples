YOLOdice examples
=================

[YOLOdice.com](https://yolodice.com) is a fast Bitcoin game that allows players to place bets with certain win probability.

This repository is a collection of Ruby scripts that use `yolodice-client` Ruby gem and [YOLOdice.com API](https://dev.yolodice.com).

Each of the scripts is a self-contained example. Any dependencies are listed in the scripts themselves.

## Installation

I recommend copying individual files and adapting them to your needs. Therefore no installation is required.

Each of the scripts depend on [yolodice-client](https://rubygems.org/gems/yolodice-client) (Github repo is [here](https://github.com/ethan-nx/yolodice-client)) gem, therefore you will need to install the gem itself:

```
gem install yolodice-client
```

If you gem is outdated, do

```
gem update yolodice-client
```

## Running the scripts

Scripts can be downloaded individually. You should paste an API KEY to your script as instructed.

# Disclaimer

The scripts are provided AS-IS. They come with absolutely no warranty. Try to read and understand the script before you run it. Authors are not responsible for any losses or damages that might result from running the scripts.
